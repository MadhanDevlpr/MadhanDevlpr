<h2 align="center"> I'm a Student, Developer and a UI Designer!!</h2>

I use canva , css, html myself as a designer, when things get out of hands Krita gets to make things more cool.

As a developer, I mainly create websites with JS and HTML and use SCSS for the style, (icons: bootstrap, fontawesome)

As a student (most important):

I like the math 100% which helps me through everything and science too creates a big impact on hardware.

No more web developing
